<H3>About mirNovo</H3>
<p>MirNovo is a new tool for the prediction of microRNAs from sequencing data. This tool processes raw or tallied FASTA/FASTQ
reads from sequencing runs and looks at patterns of read distributions using machine learning. The tool does not require
a genome and can predict microRNAs either with or without genomic information available with high accuracy.</p>

<p>We will <a href="data">download</a> an example dataset to run through the miRNovo server.</p>
<BR><BR>
<p>The test web server is <a href="http://wwwdev.ebi.ac.uk/enright-dev/mirnovo/">here</a>. This website is still beta
and has not yet been published.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some example predicted microRNAs and hairpins obtained</p>
